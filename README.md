# Project DECYDE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Decyde!

Creators: 
Tommy Ashfield and Gia Scozzarro 

Project Description: 
A tool created for the purpose of helping others who suffer from indecision on a daily basis. The idea origionally stemmed from Tommy Ashfields real life solution to the issue which was to ask the person for their top two activites/ideas, then lock each idea to a number in his head, after that he'd present the user with numbers 1 and 2 to decide what activity will be chosen for the time being. While the website has driven a little away from Tommys origional solution, we've put it a lot of time and effort to make it function properly and user friendly for everyone to enjoy.

Potential Updates(Not Promising): 
Add 2 more pages containg more fun outside/inside activities with links attached.
Make website more mobile friendly(This'll take me waaay too much time).

Final Message: 
We the creators hope you find our project useful enough to help midagate this issue and wish you to have fun in any activity we help decyde with you!
